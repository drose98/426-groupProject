Fantasy Football Player Tracking App Proposal
Our final project proposal involves creating a web application that displays fantasy sports statistics for selected players. The app will allow the user to follow their fantasy team players and keep up to date with how well they are performing. The user will be allowed to add and remove players from their follow list and will implement debouncing while searching for players. They will also be allowed to change their team name and create a mock team using HTML input field. The app will have a create an account tab that allows the user to create an account and login with their username and password. Along with that, it will store the players following and the trend for that players during that week. While logged-in users can save a lineup that is specific to them and they have the ability to post their saved lineup publically, non-logged in users will have the ability to ‘like’ the lineups that have been posted by logged-in users. Private data will include a logged-in user’s data that they do not wish to share publicly  including record and transaction history. The app will access statistics such as points, ranking, etc from an external API. The API will update the data for all the players after each game. The API will be publically available for free from a trusted source such as ESPN.

Find an API
Create a UI for the app (multiple tabs for stats, news, etc.)
Create a login page for user log in/sign up
Store login user/team name/players followed 
Create a design for how the player cards will look
Pull stats from our public API, populate player cards with the stats
Implement user functionality
